This repository contains draft versions (as releases) of the specification for the *extremely small executable* and the *extremely small loadable* file formats.

The latest draft can be found in the `specification (draft)` branch.

The specification can also be found [here](https://oscapl.github.io/Extremely-Small-File-Format/). The formatting is a bit messed up on the website though, but it's pretty readable nonetheless.
